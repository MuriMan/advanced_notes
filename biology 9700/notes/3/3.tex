\section{Enzymes}
\subsection{Mode of action of enzymes}
\begin{point}
State that enzymes are globular proteins that catalyse
reactions inside cells (intracellular enzymes) or are secreted to
catalyse reactions outside cells (extracellular enzymes)
\end{point}

\begin{point}
Explain the mode of action of enzymes in terms of an active
site, enzyme–substrate complex, lowering of activation energy
and enzyme specificity, including the lock-and-key hypothesis
and the induced-fit hypothesis
\end{point}
