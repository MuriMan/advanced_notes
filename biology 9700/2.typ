== Testing for biological molecules
#point[
Describe and carry out the Benedict’s test for reducing
sugars, the iodine test for starch, the emulsion test for lipids
and the biuret test for proteins
]
#centrebold[Reducing sugar test]\
Reducing sugars can be tested for by making them into a solution, adding Benedict's solution,
and allowing it to be heated for some time and observing colour change.
- Green colour indicates low concentration of reducing sugar present.
- Orange to red colours indicate higher concentrations of reducing sugars present, proportional
  to intensity of colour seen.

#centrebold[Iodine test]\
Adding aqueous iodine onto any substance and observing a colour change from red-brown to blue-black
indicates presence of starch.

#centrebold[Emulsion test]\
After dissolving a sample in ethanol, and mixing in water, a cloudy white emulsion should form in
presence of lipids.

#centrebold[Biuret test]\
Addition of biuret solution into sample and observing colour change from blue to purple (mauve)
indicates presence of protein.

#point[
Describe and carry out a semi-quantitative Benedict’s test
on a reducing sugar solution by standardising the test and
using the results (time to first colour change or comparison to
colour standards) to estimate the concentration
]
For higher reducing sugar concentrations, colour change takes shorter period of time. However,
semi-quantitive colour change follows
- Green colour indicates low concentration of reducing sugar present.
- Orange to red colours indicate higher concentrations of reducing sugars present, proportional
  to intensity of colour seen.

#point[
Describe and carry out a test to identify the presence of
non-reducing sugars, using acid hydrolysis and Benedict’s
solution
]
Addition of acids into a sample and then performing Benedict's test indicates presence of a
non-reducing sugar. The non-reducing sugar is hydrolysed by the acid, forming reducing sugars.

== Carbohydrates and lipids
#point[

#point[
Define the terms monomer, polymer, macromolecule,
monosaccharide, disaccharide and polysaccharide
]
A _monomer_ is a relatively simple molecule which is used as a basic building block for the
synthesis of a polymer -- many monomers join together by covalent bonds to form the polymer.

A _polymer_ is a giant molecule made from many similar repeating subunits covalently bonded
together in a chain.
#v(0.5em)
A _monosaccharide_ is a molecule consisting of a single sugar unit and with the general formula
#ch("(CH2O)_n"). Glucose, fructose and galactose are monosaccharides with six carbons (hexose),
whereas ribose and deoxyribose are monosaccharides with five carbons (pentose).

A _disaccharide_ is a sugar molecule consisting of two monosaccharides joined together by a
glycosidic bond. A _polysaccharide_ is a polymer whose subunits are monosaccharides joined
together by glycosidic bonds.

#point[
State the role of covalent bonds in joining smaller molecules
together to form polymers
]
The formation of polymers from monomers occurs due to formation of covalent bonds between the
monomers.

#point[
State that glucose, fructose and maltose are reducing sugars
and that sucrose is a non-reducing sugar
]
Note that, maltose (glucose + glucose) and sucrose (glucose + fructose) are disaccharides.

#point[
Describe the formation of a glycosidic bond by condensation,
with reference to disaccharides, including sucrose, and
polysaccharides
]
Glycosidic bonds form by _condensation reactions_, where two hydroxyl groups line up alongside
each other and one combines with a hydrogen atom from the other to form a water molecule. This
results in a link of #ch("--C--O--C--") between the two saccharide molecules. Repeated condensation
gives rise to polysaccharides.

#point[
Describe the breakage of a glycosidic bond in
polysaccharides and disaccharides by hydrolysis, with
reference to the non-reducing sugar test
]
Heating disaccharide or polysaccharide solutions in presence of hydrochloric acid breaks the
glycosidic bond and gives rise to the monomers again.

#point[
Describe the molecular structure of the polysaccharides
starch (amylose and amylopectin) and glycogen and relate
their structures to their functions in living organisms
]
Living organisms store glucose in their bodies as it is the main source of energy for cells. In
plants, the storage polysaccharide is _starch_ and in animals it is _glycogen_.
#centrebold[Starch]\
Starch is a mixture of two substances: amylose and amylopectin. _Amylose_ consists of condensations
between $alpha$-glucose molecules forming 1,4 linkages. A curved chain forms which coil up into
helical structures similar to springs, making the final molecule compact. _Amylopectin_ consists
also of 1,4 linkages but the chains are shorter than in amylose and also contain 1,6 linkages which
are branches out the sides of the chain.

#centrebold[Glycogen]\
Glycogen is the storage molecule in animals, which is made of chains of 1,4 linked $alpha$-glucose
with 1,6 linkages making branch points. The molecules clump together to form granules, visible in
liver and muscle cells.

#point[
Describe the molecular structure of the polysaccharide
cellulose and outline how the arrangement of cellulose
molecules contributes to the function of plant cell walls
]
_Cellulose_ is a polysaccharide made from $beta$-glucose subunits, which is used as a strengthening
material in plant walls. The linkages between subsequence subunits are 1,4, however the structure
of the $beta$-glucose monomer makes it such that subsequent subunits are rotated $180degree$.

#point[
State that triglycerides are non-polar hydrophobic molecules
and describe the molecular structure of triglycerides with
reference to fatty acids (saturated and unsaturated), glycerol
and the formation of ester bonds
]
_Triglycerides_ are lipids that form from ester linkages between one glycerol molecule and three
fatty acid molecules. A _saturated_ fatty acid contains only singly bonded carbon atoms and an
_unsaturated_ fatty acid contains atleast one doubly bonded carbon pair.

#point[
Relate the molecular structure of triglycerides to their functions
in living organisms
]
Triglycerides are the most common form of _lipids_. They are stored just below the skin and act as
insulators. When oxidised in respiration, triglycerides can be converted to carbon dioxide and
water, so they act as a source of energy.

#point[
Describe the molecular structure of phospholipids with
reference to their hydrophilic (polar) phosphate heads and
hydrophobic (non-polar) fatty acid tails
]
Phospholipid molecules has one end soluble in water (_hydrophillic head_) as one of the fatty acids
is replaced by a phosphate group. The two remaining fatty acids are still hydrophobic and are
called the hydrophobic tail.

== Proteins
#point[
Describe and draw the general structure of an amino acid and
the formation and breakage of a peptide bond
]
Shown below is the general structure of an amino acid.
$ #ch("HO2C--C(HR)--NH2") $

A peptide bond forms between adjacent amino acids' carboxylic acid and amine groups. The reader
is instructed, once again, to look at the book.

#point[
Explain the meaning of the terms primary structure,
secondary structure, tertiary structure and quaternary
structure of proteins
]
Proteins consist of many amino acids joined by peptide bonds. The _primary structure_ of a protein
is the sequence of amino acids in the protein.

The _secondary structure_ of a protein molecule
is that which results from the regular coiling ($alpha$-helix) and folding of the chain of amino
acids ($beta$-pleated sheets). which arises due to hidrogen bonding between the oxygen of the
#ch("C==O") group and the hydrogen of the #ch("N--H") group of the amino acid four places ahead.
If the hydrogen bonds are strong and precise, $alpha$-helix arises, otherwise the $beta$-pleated
sheets form.

The _tertiary structure_ is the compact structure of a protein molecule resulting from the
three-dimensional coiling of the amino acids. They may form due to interactions between amino acids
in close proximity. The interactions may be
- Hydrogen bonds between R groups.
- Disulfide bonds between cysteine molecules. These disulfide bonds are very strong.
- Ionic bonds may form between R groups containing amino acids and carboxyl groups.
- Hydrophobic interactions occur between R groups that are non-polar, and the hydrophobic R groups
  will tend to come together in a watery environment.

_Quaternary structure_ is the three-dimensional arrangement of two or more polypeptides, or of a
polypeptide and a non-protein component such as haem in  a protein molecule.

#point[
Describe the types of interaction that hold protein molecules
in shape:
- hydrophobic interactions
- hydrogen bonding
- ionic bonding
- covalent bonding, including disulfide bonds
]
The following interactions may occur between amino acids of protein molecules.
- Hydrophobic interactions occur between R groups that are non-polar, and the hydrophobic R groups
  will tend to come together in a watery environment.
- Hydrogen bonds between R groups.
- Ionic bonds may form between R groups containing amino acids and carboxyl groups.
- Disulfide bonds between cysteine molecules. These disulfide bonds are very strong.
