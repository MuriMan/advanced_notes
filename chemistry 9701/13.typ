= An introduction to AS Level organic chemistry
== Formulas, functional groups and the naming of organic compounds
#point[
  Define the term hydrocarbon as a compound made up of #ch("C") and #ch("H") atoms only
]
#point[
Understand that alkanes are simple hydrocarbons with no functional group
]
#point[
Understand that the compounds in the table on pages 29 and 30 contain a functional group which
dictates their physical and chemical properties
]
It is recommended that the reader looks at the table mentioned here in the specification.

Organic compounds contain _functional groups_ which are groups of atoms bonded to the
organic compound that give the compound its characteristic chemical properties.

#point[
Interpret and use the general, structural, displayed and skeletal formulas of the classes of compound
stated in the table on pages 29 and 30
]
For lack of time and of expertise with Typst, I have forgone this for the time being.
#point[
Understand and use systematic nomenclature of simple aliphatic organic molecules with functional
groups detailed in the table on pages 29 and 30, up to six carbon atoms (six plus six for esters, straight
chains only for esters and nitriles)
]
Read the book. It's simple but elaborate and I lack the machinery and expertise with this subject
to explain the mechanisms.
#point[
Deduce the molecular and/or empirical formula of a compound, given its structural, displayed or
skeletal formula
]
The molecular formula is that where the number of atoms of elements present in a compound is
displayed. The empirical formula is the simplest ratio of the number of atoms of elements present
in a compound. We may do the above by simply counting.

== Characteristic organic reactions
#point[
Interpret and use the following terminology associated with types of organic compounds and reactions:
#set enum(numbering: "(a)")
+ homologous series
+ saturated and unsaturated
+ homolytic and heterolytic fission
+ free radical, initiation, propagation, termination
+ nucleophile, electrophile, nucleophilic, electrophilic
+ addition, substitution, elimination, hydrolysis, condensation
+ oxidation and reduction
(in equations for organic redox reactions, the symbol [O] can be used to represent one atom of oxygen
from an oxidising agent and the symbol [H] to represent one atom of hydrogen from a reducing agent)
]
A _homologous series_ is a group of organic compounds having the same functional group, the same
general formula and similar chemical properties.

A _saturated_ hydrocarbon is that where all the carbon--carbon bonds are single, and an
unsaturated hydrocarbon is that where at least one carbon--carbon bond is either double or
triple.

Fission is the breakage of a covalent bond. It is of two types.
- _Homolytic fission_ is where the atoms involved each get one electron from the bond. This forms
  two radicals.
  $ #ch("X--Y->X* + Y*") $
- _Heterolytic fission_ is where one of the atoms involved gets both the bonding electrons. This
  forms an anion and a cation.
  $ #ch("X--Y -> X- + Y+") $

A _free radical_ is a species that possesses one or more unpaired electrons. In reactions called
_free radical substitution_, the reaction progresses via steps classified as _initiation_, 
_propagation_ and _termination_. This is elaborated later.

A _nucleophile_ is a species attracted to positive charges, the species itself may be (partially)
negatively charged. An _electrophile_ is the opposite. The words _nucleophilic_ and
_electrophilic_ are simply adjective forms of the previous.

_Addition_ reactions are where reactants form one product only. _Elimination_ reactions are where
the functional group is removed from the organic compound being reacted with. _Hydrolysis_ occurs
when water is absorbed into an organic compound, giving two or more organic compounds. 
_Condensation_ is when water or a small molecule is released from a compound.

The above are descriptions for types of organic reactions, elaborations on which will follow.
#point[
Understand and use the following terminology associated with types of organic mechanisms:
#set enum(numbering: "(a)")
+ free-radical substitution
+ electrophilic addition
+ nucleophilic substitution
+ nucleophilic addition
(in organic reaction mechanisms, the use of curly arrows to represent movement of electron pairs is
expected; the arrow should begin at a bond or a lone pair of electrons)
]
I am in a hurry and I already understand these things.

== Shapes of organic molecules; $sigma$ and $pi$ bonds
#point[Describe organic molecules as either straight-chained, branched or cyclic]
Describe them.

#point[Describe and explain the shape of, and bond angles in, molecules containing $"sp"$, $"sp"^2$
and $"sp"^3$ hybridised atoms]
Triple bonded carbon atoms are $"sp"$ hybridised, double bonded carbon atoms are $"sp"^2$
hybridised and single bonded carbon atoms are $"sp"^3$ hybridised.

For $"sp"^3$ orbitals, the bond angle is $180degree$, $120degree$ for $"sp"^2$ orbitals and
$109.5degree$ for $"sp"$ orbitals.

#point[Describe the arrangement of $sigma$ and $pi$ bonds in molecules containing $"sp"$,
$"sp"^2$ and $"sp"^3$ hybridised atoms]
In multiple bonds, one of the bond is a sigma bond and the rest are pi bonds.

#point[Understand and use the term planar when describing the arrangement of atoms in organic
molecules, for example ethene]
Geometric intuition.

== Isomerism: structural isomerism and stereoisomerism
#point[Describe structural isomerism and its division into chain, positional and functional group
isomerism]
_Structural isomerism_ arises among molecules that have the same molecular formula but different
structural formulae. It is of the following types
- *Chain.* Arises when branching occurs within the carbon chain.
- *Positional.*  Arises due to change in position of side groups.
- *Functional group.* Arises when the functional groups of the isomers are different.

#point[Describe stereoisomerism and its division into geometrical (cis/trans) and optical isomerism
(use of E/Z nomenclature is acceptable but is not required)]
_Stereoisomerism_ arises amongst molecules of same structural formula but different spatial
arrangements of of the atoms. It is of two types
- *Geometrical (cis/trans).* Geometrical isomerism arises due to the limited rotational capability
  of $pi$ bonds in #ch("C==C"). Geometrical isomers can either be _trans_ or _cis_. In _cis_
  isomers, the heavier side groups are on the same side of the carbon, and in _trans_ isomers,
  the heavier side groups are on opposite sides of the carbon.
- *Optical (enantiomerism).* Optical isomerism arises when when two molecules with same
  the structural formula that cannot be superimposed. This is a property of a _chiral carbon_
  or a _chiral centre_ which has bonded to it four different side groups.

#point[ Describe geometrical (cis/trans) isomerism in alkenes, and explain its origin in terms of 
restricted rotation due to the presence of $pi$ bonds]
Geometrical isomerism arises due to the limited rotational capability of $pi$ bonds in #ch("C==C")

#point[Explain what is meant by a chiral centre and that such a centre gives rise to two optical
isomers (enantiomers)\
(Candidates should appreciate that compounds can contain more than one chiral centre, but knowledge
of meso compounds, or nomenclature such as diastereoisomers is not required.)]
_Chiral carbons_ or _chiral centres_ is a carbon that has bonded to it, four different groups.

#point[
Identify chiral centres and geometrical (cis/trans) isomerism in a molecule of given structural
formula including cyclic compounds
]
It is a matter of skill, and elaboration I shall not go into.

#point[
Deduce the possible isomers for an organic molecule of known molecular formula
]
The number of possible stereoisomers of a given organic compound is given by
$ x = 2^n $
where $n$ is the number of chiral centres and (applicable) double bonds possessed by the organic
compound.
