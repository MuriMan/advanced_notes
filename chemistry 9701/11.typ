= Group 17
== Physical properties of the Group 17 elements
The Group 17 elements are called the _halogens_.
#point[Describe the colours and the trend in volatility of chlorine, bromine and iodine]
The _volatility_ of a substance is the ease with which it eveaporates.
- Fluorine is a pale yellow gas
- Chlorine is a pale yellow-green gas
- Bromine is an orange-brown liquid
- Iodine is a grey-black solid
_Volatility decreases down the group._ This is because evaporation requires the breaking of
intermolecular forces. In halogens, the intermolecular forces are in the form of 
id--id#footnote[instantaneous dipole--induced dipole] forces, and down the group, the number
of electrons per molecule increases. Thus, down the group, intermolecular forces increase,
and hence volatility decreases.

#point[Describe and explain the trend in the bond strength of the halogen molecules]
_The halogens get less reactive going down Group 17._ This is because the electronegativity of the
halogen molecule  decreases down the group, which is because of the trend in atomic radii of the
elements in the group. In the example of fluorine, its outer shell is nearest to the
attractive force of the nucleus and an electron entering its outer shell will  also experience
the least shielding from the attraction of the positive nuclear charge. _Greater shielding
outweighs the attraction to electrons from the significantly greater nuclear charge down the 
group, hence, bond strength decreases down the group._

#point[Interpret the volatility of the elements in terms of instantaneous dipole--induced dipole
forces]
_Volatility decreases down the group._ This is because evaporation requires the breaking of
intermolecular forces. In halogens, the intermolecular forces are in the form of 
id--id forces, and down the group, the number
of electrons per molecule increases. Thus, down the group, intermolecular forces increase,
and hence volatility decreases.

== The chemical properties of the halogen elements and the hydrogen halides
#point[Describe the relative reactivity of the elements as oxidising agents]
As described above, the electronegativity of the elements decreases down the group. As a result,
the ability of the element to gain electrons, or be reduced, or act as an oxidising agent, also
decreases.

Thus, it follows that _the oxidising power of the halogens decreases going down Group 17._

#point[Describe the reactions of the elements with hydrogen and explain their relative reactivity 
in these reactions]
The halogens form halogen halides when combined with hydrogen gas.
- Fluorine reacts explosively even in cool, dark conditions
$ #ch("H2  (g) + F2  (g) -> 2HF (g)") $
- Chlorine reacts explosively in sunlight
$ #ch("H2  (g) + Cl2  (g) -> 2HCl (g)") $
#pagebreak()
- Bromine reacts slowly on heating
$ #ch("H2  (g) + Br2  (g) -> 2HBr (g)") $
- Iodine forms an equilibrium mixture on heating
$ #ch("H2  (g) + I2  (g) <=> 2HI (g)") $
Note that the vigour of reaction decreases down the group.

#point[
Describe the relative thermal stabilities of the hydrogen halides and explain these in terms of
bond strengths
]
The strength of the #ch("H--X") bond, where X is a halogen, decreases down the group for reasons
discussed above. The strength of a bond is related directly to its bond energy. Down the group,
the bond energy of the #ch("H--X") decreases.

As a result, the thermal stability of a hydrogen halide decreases down the group. The general
equation of the thermal decomposition of a hydrogen halide is as below
$ #ch("2HX (g) -> H2  (g) + X2  (g)  ") $

== Some reactions of the halide ions
#point[Describe the relative reactivity of halide ions as reducing agents]
Same as in the case for elements, _reactivity of halide ions as reducing agents decreases down the
group_.

#point[Describe and explain the reactions of halide ions with:
  #set enum(numbering: "(a)")
  + aqueous silver ions followed by aqueous ammonia (the formation and formula of the
    #ch("[Ag(NH3)2]+") complex is not required)
  + concentrated sulfuric acid, to include balanced chemical equations
]
#centrebold[Aqueous silver ions followed by aqueous ammonia]\
The above reaction may act as a test for the halide ions. Addition of aqueous ions gives the
following observations in presence of the following halide ions
- White precipitate of silver chloride forms in presence of chloride.
- Cream precipitate  of silver bromide forms in presence of bromine.
- Yellow precipitate of silver iodide forms in presence of iodide.
Addition of aqueous ammonia causes dissolution of the precipitates to varying extents.
- White precipitate of silver chloride dissolves completely in presence of aqueous ammonia.
- Cream precipitate of silver bromide dissolves completely in presence of aqueous ammonia.
- Yellow precipitate of silver iodide dissolves completely in presence of aqueous ammonia.

== The reactions of chlorine
#point[
Describe and interpret, in terms of changes in oxidation number, the reaction of chlorine with cold
and with hot aqueous sodium hydroxide and recognise these as disproportionation reactions
]
#centrebold[With cold aqeuous sodium hydroxide]\
The reaction is
$ #ch("Cl2  (aq) + 2NaOH (aq) -> NaCl (aq) + NaClO (aq) + H2O (l)") $
note that, the oxidation state of chlorine goes from 0 to $-1$ in NaCl and from 0 to $+1$ in
NaClO. This reaction is said to be a disproportionation reaction as chlorine is both oxidised and
reduced. The ionic equation is
$ #ch("Cl2  (aq)+2OH-  (aq) -> Cl-  (aq) + ClO-  (aq) + H2O (l)") $

#centrebold[With hot aqueous sodium hydroxide]\
$ #ch("3Cl2  (aq) + 6NaOH (aq) -> 5NaCl (aq) + NaClO3  (aq) + 3H2O (l)") $
note that, the oxidation state of chlorine goes from 0 to -1 in NaCl and from 0 to +5 in
#ch("NaClO3"). A disproportionation reaction occurs here too.

#point[
Explain, including by use of an equation, the use of chlorine in water purification to include 
the production of the active species #ch("HOCl") and #ch("ClO-") which kill bacteria
]
Water is chlorinated by the following reaction
$ #ch("Cl2  (aq) + H2O (l) -> HCl (aq) + HClO (aq)") $
note that, the oxidation state of chlorine goes from 0 to -1 in HCl and from 0 to +1 in HClO
(called chloric (I) acid). The #ch("ClO-") ion, which forms when the chloric (I) acid dissociates
in water, kills bacteria and hence, a small amount of chlorine is added into the central water
supply to sanitise the water supply.
