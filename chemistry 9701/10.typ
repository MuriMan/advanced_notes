= Group 2
== Similarities and trends in the properties of the Group 2 metals, magnesium to barium, and their compounds
#point[Describe, and write equations for, the reactions of the elements with oxygen, water and dilute
hydrochloric and sulfuric acids]
Group 2 consists of the following elements: beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium and
radium. _Reactivity increases down the group._

#centrebold[Reactions with oxygen]\
The metals all form _white solid oxides_. Reactivity of the metals with oxygen
increases down the group as the larger atoms lose their outer two electrons more readily than the
smaller atoms in the group.
- Magnesium ribbon burns with a bright white flame once it is ignited in a Bunsen flame
$ 2"Mg (s)" + "O"_2 "(g)" --> 2"MgO (s)" $

#centrebold[Reactions with water]\
- Magnesium reacts very slowly with cold water, giving a weakly alkaline solution
  $ "Mg (s)" + 2"H"_2"O (l)" --> "Mg(OH)"_2 "(aq)" + "H"_2 "(g)" $
  Hot magnesium howvever, reacts with steam to give magnesium oxide and hydrogen gas
  $ "Mg (s)" + "H"_2"O (g)" --> "MgO (s)" + "H"_2"O" $
- Calcium reacts more readily than magnesium with water at room temperature, giving a steady
  stream of hydrogen gas, forming a cloudy white suspension of slightly soluble calcium hydroxide.
  $ "Ca (s)" + 2"H"_2"O (l)" --> "Ca(OH)"_2 "(aq)"+"H"_2 "(g)" $

#centrebold[Reactions with acid]\
The reactions have the general form
$ "X (s)" + 2"HCl (aq)" --> "XCl"_2 "(aq)" + "H"_2"O (l)" $
where X is a Group 2 element.

#point[Describe, and write equations for, the reactions of the oxides, hydroxides and carbonates
with water and dilute hydrochloric and sulfuric acids]
#centrebold[Reactions of oxides with water]\
- Magnesium, which is slightly soluble in water, and forms a weakly alkaline solution of
  magnesium hydroxide.
  $ "MgO (s)" + "H"_2"O (l)" --> "Mg(OH)"_2 "(aq)" $
  where $"Mg(OH)"_2$ has pH 10
- When water is dripped onto the surface of a lump of calcium oxide it causes a vigoroous
  reaction, which releases so much energy that some of the water boils off as the solid lump
  appears to expand and crack open
  $ "CaO (s)" + "H"_2"O (l)" --> "Ca(OH)"_2 "(aq)" $

In general, the dissolving of Group 2 metal oxides in water is given by the following ionic
equation
$ "O"^(2-) "(aq)" + "H"_2"O (l)" --> 2"OH"^- "(aq)" $
and thus we see that the Group 2 oxides are basic.

_The solutions formed from the reactions of the Group 2 metal oxides with water get more alkaline
going down the group_ and _the solubility of the Group 2 hydroxides increases going down Group 2._

#centrebold[Reactions of oxides with acid]\
The basic oxides of the Group 2 metals are neutralised by dilute acid. The general equation for
the reaction of a basic oxide is
$ "basic oxide" + "dilute acid" --> "salt" + "water" $
e.g.
$ "MgO (s)" + 2"HCl (aq)" --> "MgCl"_2 "(aq)" + "H"_2"O (l)" $
where the white magnesium oxide powder dissolves, forming a colourless solution of magnesium
chloride. The oxides of calcium, strontium and barium are also neutralised similarly by dilute
acid.

Similar reactions occur in case of reaction with dilute sulfuric acid
$ "MgO (s)" + "H"_2"SO"_4 "(aq)" --> "MgSO"_4 "(aq)" + "H"_2"O (l)" $
Note that, _the Group 2 sulfates get less soluble going down the group_. So, any and all
insoluble sulfates will form at the surface of the oxides, protecting any solid oxide beneath.
However, when the oxide is in the form of a powder and stirred, significant neutralisation can
occur.

#centrebold[Reactions of hydroxides with water]\
The hydroxides simply dissolve, to varying extents depending on position in the group. Remember
that _the solubility of the Group 2 hydroxides increases going down Group 2._

#centrebold[Reactions of hydroxides with acid]\
The alkaline hydroxides of the Group 2 metals will all be neutralised by dilute acid with general
equation
$ "hydroxide" + "dilute acid" --> "salt" + "water" $
e.g.
$ "Mg(OH)"_2 "(s)" + 2"HCl (aq)" --> "MgCl"_2 "(aq)" + 2"H"_2"O (l)" $
$ "Mg(OH)"_2 "(s)" + "H"_2"SO"_4 "(aq)" --> "MgSO"_4 "(aq)" + 2"H"_2"O (l)" $
or with barium hydroxide solution
$ "Ba(OH)"_2 "(s)" + 2"HCl (aq)" --> "BaCl"_2 "(aq)" + 2"H"_2"O (l)" $
$ "Ba(OH)"_2 "(s)" + "H"_2"SO"_4 "(aq)" --> "BaSO"_4 "(s)" + 2"H"_2"O (l)" $
Here, the barium sulfate forms as a white precipitate, unlike the soluble barium chloride (a
colourless solution).

#centrebold[Reactions of carbonates with water]\
All Group 2 carbonates are insoluble in water.

#centrebold[Reactions of carbonates with acid]\
A general equation is enough to show that
$ "carbonate" + "acid" --> "salt" + "water" + "carbon dioxide" $

_The sulfates of calcium, strontium and barium tend to form as an insoluble sulfate layer on
their solid carbonates._

#point[Describe, and write equations for, the thermal decomposition of the nitrates and carbonates,
to include the trend in thermal stabilities]
The general equation for the decomposition of a Group 2 carbonate follows
$ "XCO"_3 "(s)" --> "XO (s)" + "CO"_2 "(g)" $
and the same for Group 2 nitrates
$ 2"X(NO"_3")"_2 --> 2"XO (s)" + 4"NO"_2 "(g)" + "O"_2 "(g)" $
A _brown gas_ is observed when a Group 2 nitrate is heated, which is _toxic_ nitrogen dioxide
(nitrogen (IV) oxide).

_As with the carbonates, a higher temperature is needed to thermally decompose the nitrates as
Group 2 is descended._
