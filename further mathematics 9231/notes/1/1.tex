\subsection{Roots of polynomial equations}

\begin{point}
Recall and use the relations between the roots
and coefficients of polynomial equations
\end{point}
\centrebold{Quadratics}
The quadratic equation follows,
\begin{align*}
ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\
\implies x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = 0
\end{align*}
which has roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$,
\begin{align*}
(x - \alpha)(x - \beta) = 0 \\
\implies x^2 - (\alpha + \beta) x + \alpha\beta = 0
\end{align*}
hence, considering that, $S_n = \alpha^n + \beta^n$,
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\alpha = S_1 = \alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a}} \\ $$
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\alpha\beta = \alpha\beta = \frac{c}{a}} $$
where $\Sigma\alpha$ and $\Sigma\alpha\beta$ are referred to as \emph{sum of
roots} and \emph{product of roots}, respectively.

Furthermore,
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\alpha^2 = S_2 = \alpha^2 + \beta^2 = (\Sigma\alpha)^2
- 2\Sigma\alpha\beta} $$
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\frac{1}{\alpha} = S_{-1} =\frac{1}{\alpha} + \frac{1}{\beta} =
\frac{\alpha + \beta}{\alpha\beta} = \frac{\Sigma\alpha}{\Sigma\alpha\beta}} $$
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\frac{1}{\alpha^2} = S_{-2} = \frac{1}{\alpha^2} + 
\frac{1}{\beta^2} = \frac{\alpha^2 + \beta^2}{\alpha^2\beta^2}
= \frac{\Sigma\alpha^2}{(\Sigma\alpha\beta)^2}}$$

Using $S_n$ as defined above, we can use known values of $S_n$ to find values
required.
\begin{important}
Consider the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ with roots $\alpha$ and
$\beta$. To find certain values of $S_n$, we must multiply the equation with
a certain power of $x$, to achieve a power of $x$ in the equation that equals
the value of $n$ desired.

For example, when we want $S_{-1}$, we must first multiply the original 
equation by $x^{-1}$, giving us,
$$ ax + b + \frac{c}{x} = 0 $$

We can now plug $x = \alpha$ and $x = \beta$, since they are roots,
\begin{align}
	a\alpha + b + \frac{c}{\alpha} = 0 \\
	a\beta + b + \frac{c}{\beta} = 0 \\
	a(\alpha + \beta) + 2b + \left(\frac{1}{\alpha}+\frac{1}{\beta}\right)c = 0
	\tag{1 + 2} \\
	\implies aS_1 + 2b + cS_{-1} = 0 \notag
\end{align}
here, if we know $S_1$, we can find $S_{-1}$.

Note that, the coefficients are multiplied by $S_n$, where $n$ equals the
power of $x$ to which they are a coefficient, and the constant terms are
multiplied by 2.
\end{important}

\centrebold{Cubics}
\noindent{}The cubic equation follows,
\begin{align*}
ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \\
\implies x^3 + \frac{b}{a}x^2 + \frac{c}{a}x + \frac{d}{a} = 0
\end{align*}
which has roots $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$,
\begin{align*}
(x - \alpha)(x - \beta)(x - \gamma) = 0 \\
\implies x^3 - (\alpha + \beta + \gamma)x^2 + (\alpha\beta + \alpha\gamma +
\beta\gamma)x - \alpha\beta\gamma = 0
\end{align*}
thus, using $S_n = \alpha^n + \beta^n + \gamma^n$,
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\alpha = S_1 = \alpha + \beta + \gamma = -\frac{b}{a}} $$
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\alpha\beta = \alpha\beta + \alpha\gamma + \beta\gamma =
\frac{c}{a}} $$
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\alpha\beta\gamma = \alpha\beta\gamma = -\frac{d}{a}} $$

Following this,
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\alpha^2 = S_2 = (\alpha + \beta + \gamma)^2 =
(\Sigma\alpha)^2 - 2\Sigma\alpha\beta} $$
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\alpha^3 = (\Sigma\alpha)^3 - 3\Sigma\alpha\beta\Sigma\alpha
+ 3\Sigma\alpha\beta\gamma} $$

\begin{important}
Here too, values of $S_n$ can be found in the method demonstrated in the
\textbf{Quadratics} section. Note that, in such cases the constant term is
multiplied by 3.
\end{important}

\centrebold{Quartics}
The quartic equation
$$ x^4 + \frac{b}{a}x^3 + \frac{c}{a}x^2 + \frac{d}{a}x + \frac{e}{a} = 0 $$
has roots $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$. Due to the monstrous
nature of the equation, it is best to use 
$S_n = \alpha^n + \beta^n + \gamma^n + \delta^n$ notation.

$$ \boxed{\Sigma\alpha = -\frac{b}{a}} $$
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\alpha\beta = \frac{c}{a}} $$
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\alpha\beta\gamma = -\frac{d}{a}} $$
$$ \boxed{\Sigma\alpha\beta\gamma\delta = \frac{e}{a}} $$
$$ \boxed{S_2 = (\Sigma\alpha)^2 - 2\Sigma\alpha\beta} $$
$$ \boxed{S_{-1} = \frac{\Sigma\alpha\beta\gamma}{\Sigma\alpha\beta\gamma\delta
}} $$

\begin{point}
Use a substitution to obtain an equation whose
roots are related in a simple way to those of the
original equation
\end{point}
If we are given a known polynomial whose roots we also know, we can find
any other unknown polynomial given that its roots are in terms of the roots
of the first given polynomial. We must first write out the unknown polynomial
in factorised form as per its roots and compare with the initial polynomial,
finding values of the roots and arriving at the unknown polynomial.
This is illustrated in the following:

\begin{important}
\emph{
Given the quadratic $x^2 + 3x + 5 = 0$ with roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$, find
the quadratic that has roots $2\alpha$ and $2\beta$.
}

The unknown quadratic is
\begin{align*}
(y - 2\alpha)(y - 2\beta) = 0 \\
\implies y^2 - (2\alpha + 2\beta)y + 4\alpha\beta = 0
\end{align*}
comparing with the original, we find
$$ \alpha + \beta = -3 $$
$$ \alpha\beta = 5 $$

Solving simultaneously, we find $\boxed{y^2 + 6y + 20 = 0}$ to be the quadratic
asked for in the question.
\end{important}

Alternatively, we can derive a relationship between the roots of both 
equations. For the same question as above:
\begin{important}
The new quadratic has $y = 2x \implies x = y/2$ since each root of the 
new quadratic is twice that of the given one. Thus, plugging the above
into the original equation:
\begin{align*}
	\left(\frac{y}{2}\right)^2 + 3\left(\frac{y}{2}\right) + 5 = 0 \\
	\implies \Aboxed{y^2 + 6y + 20 = 0}
\end{align*}
\end{important}

For roots raised to a certain power, we may use the above method or we can
modify the original equation such that the above method becomes more
convenient.
\begin{important}
The cubic $2x^3 + 7x^2 -1 = 0$ has roots $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$. Find
the cubic with roots $\alpha^2$, $\beta^2$ and $\gamma^2$.

Here, $y = x^2$. We can manipulate the given equation such that substituting
this relationship is made simpler.
\begin{align*}
	2x^3 + 7x^2 -1 &= 0 \\
	\implies \left(2x^3\right)^2 &= \left(1 - 7x\right)^2 \\
	\implies 4x^6 &= 1 - 14x^2 + 49x^4
\end{align*}
hence,
$$ \boxed{4y^3 + 49y^2 + 14y - 1 = 0} $$
\end{important}

\newpage
High $n$ values fo $S_n$ can be found conveniently using the substitution
method. We must formulate another polynomial of the same degree as that given
but with roots of a higher power. As such the $n$ values required for
the $S_n$ with the new polynomial would be lower for the same result. Observe:
\begin{important}
\emph{Given $x^4 + x^3 - 5 = 0$, find $S_4$.}

Considering that the given quartic has roots $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$
and $\delta$, we consider another such that the roots are $y = x^2$. For this
quartic, $S_n = \alpha^{2n} + \beta^{2n} + \gamma^{2n} + \delta^{2n}$.\footnotemark{}
In this case, $S_2$ of the new polynomial equals $S_4$ for the given 
polynomial. So, we find the new polynomial:

\begin{align*}
x^4 - 5 &= -x^3 \\
\implies x^8 - 10x^4 + 25 &= x^6 \\
\implies y^4 -y^3 - 10y^2 + 25 &= 0 \\
\end{align*}

Hence, $S_1 = 1$ and $S_2 = 1^2 - 2(-10) = 21$. Thus $\boxed{S_4 = 21}$.
\end{important}
\footnotetext{More generally, for a polynomial with roots $y = x^m$, $S_n =
\alpha^{mn} + \beta^{mn} ...$ and so on.}

\subsection{Rational functions and graphs}
\begin{point}
Sketch graphs of simple rational functions,
including the determination of oblique
asymptotes, in cases where the degree of the
numerator and the demoninator are at most 2
\end{point}
A \define{rational function} is that which can be defined as an algebraic
fraction with polynomials as its numerator \emph{and} denominator. An
\define{asymptote} is generally a line that a curve approaches but never
touches. Functions of the form:
$$ f(x) = \frac{ax + b}{cx + d} $$
have asymptotes that are vertical and horizontal, which are found as below,
\begin{align*}
	cx + d &> 0 \\
	\implies x &> -\frac{d}{c}
\end{align*}
thus, the vertical asymptote is:
$$ \boxed{x = -\frac{d}{c}} $$

Let $f(x) = y$
\begin{align*}
	y &= \frac{ax+b}{cx+d} \\
	\implies x &= \frac{dy-b}{a-cy} \\\\
	a - cy > 0 \\
	\implies y < \frac{a}{c}
\end{align*}
thus, the horizontal asymptote is 
$$ \boxed{y = \frac{a}{c}} $$

For curves with a quadratic denominator, we observe the following:
\begin{important}
\emph{Given $y = \dfrac{x}{(x-1)(x-2)}$, determine its coordinate intercepts,
asymptotes, turning points and hence sketch the curve.}

For the coordinate intercepts, we simply plug in $x = 0$ and $y = 0$, getting
finding that the curve passes through the origin $\boxed{(0, 0)}$.

It is easy to see that the vertical asymptotes are $x = 1$ and $x = 2$, and
for $|x| \to \infty$, $y = 0$, the horizontal asymptote.

The turning points of the curve may be found by differentiating and
solving the derivative for zero, for which we find \fbox{$(2 + \sqrt{2}, 1)$
and $(2 - \sqrt{2}, 1)$}. We plug $x$ values \emph{slightly} greater
and less than that of the turning points to see if the curve increases or
decreases on either side.

To find the ``gap" in the curve, we cross multiply to find a quadratic 
equation:
$$ yx^2 + (-1 - 3y)x + 2y = 0 $$
whose discriminant is as follows:
$$ (-1 - 3y)^2 - 4(y)(2y) = y^2 + 6y + 1 $$
if we set the discriminant to less than zero, we find an equality in terms
of $y$ where the curve does not exist.

$$ y^2 + 6y + 1 < 0 $$
$$ \boxed{-3 - 2\sqrt{2} < y < -3 + 2\sqrt{2}} $$
Thus, for the lower bound of this inequality, we have $x = \sqrt{2}$. Now
we may sketch the curve:\vspace{2pt}
\begin{center}
\fbox{
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{axis}[
		domain=-1:3.5,
		samples=300,
		xlabel=$x$,
		ylabel=$y$,
		axis lines=middle,
		enlargelimits,
		xtick={-1,0,1,2,3,3.5},
		ytick=\empty,
		ymin=-15, ymax=15,
		restrict y to domain=-15:15,
		clip=false,
		legend pos=north west,
		]
	% Plot the function with gaps at vertical asymptotes
		\addplot [
			thick,
			unbounded coords=jump,
			]
			{x / ((x-1)*(x-2))};

	% Draw vertical asymptotes
		\addplot [dashed] coordinates {(1,-15) (1,-3)};
		\addplot [dashed] coordinates {(1,0) (1,15)};
		\addplot [dashed] coordinates {(2,-15) (2,-3)};
		\addplot [dashed] coordinates {(2,0) (2,15)};

	\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
}
\end{center}
\end{important}

For a curve which has quadratics as both numerator and denominator:
\begin{align*}
	y = \frac{ax^2+ bx + c}{dx^2 + ex + f} \\
	\implies (dy - ay)x^2 + (ey - by)x + (fy - cy) = 0
\end{align*}
using the discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$ and setting it to less than zero gives us
values of $y$ such that the curve does not exist.

We may also observe the following:
\begin{align*}
	y &= \frac{ax^2 + bx + c}{dx^2 + ex + f} \\
	  &= \frac{(x^2)(a + b/x + c/x^2)}{(x^2)(d + e/x + f/x^2)} \\
	  &= \frac{a + b/x + c/x^2}{d + e/x + 
		  f/x^2}
\end{align*}
thus, as $x \to \infty$, $y \to a/d$, and hence the horizontal asymtote is:
$$ \boxed{y = \frac{a}{d}} $$
